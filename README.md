# dSCA

demixed Sparse Component Analysis.
demix the neural signal elicited by different task variables e.g. (Stim1, Stim2, Time/context)
Sparse component analysis allow dimensionality reduction while taking into account the constraint of biological implementation (neurons have small number of synapses compared to the number of neurons in a cortical region). This will usually also yield small groups of dominant neurons.
In another interpretation, SCA finds the response profile of the hypothetical sources.
